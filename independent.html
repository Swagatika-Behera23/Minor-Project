            <h4>The Indian independence movement, a century-long struggle against British colonial rule,
              <span id="color_text">culminated in India's independence on August 15, 1947</span>  marked by the partition into India and Pakistan.
               The Indian independence movement, a period of resistance against British colonial rule, spanned from the late 19th century to 1947,
                culminating in India's independence and the partition of the subcontinent. </h4>
                <h1>Key Events and Movements:</h1>
                          <h2>Early Resistance:</h2>
                               The seeds of the Indian independence movement were sown with the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, though it was not successful, it ignited the desire for self-rule. 
                           <h2>Rise of Nationalism:</h2>
                               The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, played a crucial role in organizing the movement and advocating for self-governance. 
                           <h2>Gandhi's Leadership:</h2>
                               Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent resistance and movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920), the Civil Disobedience Movement (including the Dandi March in 1930), and the Quit India Movement (1942) gained momentum for independence. 
                           <h2>World War II's Impact:</h2>
                               The war weakened Britain's grip on India, and the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946 further strained British control. 
                          <h2>Partition and Independence:</h2>
                               The Indian Independence Act of 1947, passed by the British Parliament, formally granted independence to India and Pakistan on August 15, 1947. 
                          <h2>Partition's Aftermath:</h2>
                               The partition led to immense displacement and violence, with millions of people migrating across the newly formed borders. 
                          <h2>Formation of the Dominion of India:</h2>
                               Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of the Dominion of India, which was a member of the British Commonwealth. 
                          <h2>Establishment of the Republic:</h2>
                               India became a democratic republic on January 26, 1950, with a Westminster-style parliamentary system.
